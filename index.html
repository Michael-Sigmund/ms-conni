        Conni Container
      </b>
      and I'm a cute little service.<br><br>
      I am running in the most advanced IT environment consisting of <b>IBM Public Cloud, IBM Cloud Satellite, Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift.</b><br>In fact, as  I'm a container, I can <b>be everywhere</b> where <b>Red Hat OpenShift</b> is installed and these are tons of places all around the world.<br>
      Of course, I can also <b>run in other clouds like AWS or Azure</b> or <b>even at your location</b> but to be honest, I feel best in an IBM Cloud Center.<br><br>
      Currently, I'm visiting the <b>IBM Cloud Center in Frankfurt</b> which is a very safe multi-zone Public Cloud Center. <br>It's very comfortable here as I'm on a dedicated server so nothing can disturb me. <br>Soon, I will be in a virtual private cloud
      (VPC) where absolutely nobody can touch me who is not allowed to.<br><br>
      Michael, my creator, is a very poor person and he has got absolutely no resources available besides his laptop. <br>But he found everything he needs for me in the <b>IBM Public Cloud.</b><br><br>
      As he has got no time at all to permanently check if everything is fine with me, he uses <b>IBM Cloud Satellite</b>, <br>a service which takes care of me all day and night the whole week long. <br>This service is just great and
      it's currently available in London only but it will <b>soon be in Frankfurt, too.</b><br>Then I can start my journey to all locations I'm invited to, but <b>everything personal about me stays in Frankfurt.</b> <br><br><b> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;What a good feeling !</b><br><br>
      If you are <b>interested in how everything works</b>, how Michael sets everything up and which great container friends I have, <br>feel free to contact Michael under <b>msigmund@de.ibm.com</b> or just call him at <b>+49 172 7325604</b>. <br><br><b>&emsp;&emsp;He will be happy to
      talk to you.</b><br><br>
      See you soon in the next <b>IBM Cloud Satellite location</b> wherever this will be ...
