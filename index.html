        Conni Container
      </b>
      and I'm a very small cute service.<br><br>
      I'm running in the most advanced IT environment consisting of <b>IBM Public Cloud, IBM Cloud Satellite, Kubernetes and Redhat Openshift.</b><br>
      As I'm a container, I can <b>run everywhere</b> where <b>Redhat Openshift</b> is installed and these are tons of places all around the world. <br><br>Currently I'm
      running in the <b>IBM Cloud Center in Frankfurt</b> which is a very save multi-zone Public Cloud Center. It's very comfortable here <br>as I'm on a dedicated server so that nobody can disturb me. <br>Soon I will be in a virtual private network
      (VPC). Then absolutely nobody who is not allowed to can touch me. <br>Of course I can also <b>run in other clouds like AWS or Azure</b> or <b>even at your location</b> but to be honest, I feel best in an IBM Cloud Center.<br><br>
      Michael, my creator, is a very poor person and he has got absolutely no hardware available beside his laptop. <br>But he found everything he needs for me in the <b>IBM Public Cloud.</b><br>
      As he has got no time at all to permanently check if everything is right with me he used <b>IBM Cloud Satellite</b>, a service <br>which looks for me all day an night the whole week long. <br>This service is just great and
      it runs currently in London but it will be soon in Frankfurt, too. <br>Then I can start my travel to all locations I'm invited to but everything personal stays in Frankfurt. <br><br><b> What a good feeling.</b><br><br>
      If you <b>interested in how everything works</b>, how Michael sets everything up and what great container friends I have, feel free <br>to contact Michael under <b>msigmund@de.ibm.com</b> or just phone him <b>+49 172 7325604</b>. He will be
      happy to
      talk to you.<br><Br>
      See you soon in the next <b>IBM Cloud Satellite location ...</b>
